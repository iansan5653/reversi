I really like Reversi (also known as Othello) and got tired of having to watch
ads or deal with popups just to be able to play it. So I built this basic,
simple, fast Reversi game with no frills and no distractions. Just grab a
friend, open it and start playing. Refresh the page to restart.

Build using Create React App and TypeScript.
